懐かしき、故郷を貫く鮎の川。
黄金郷を目指す者よ、これを下りて鍵を探せ。

川を下れば、やがて里あり。
その里にて二人が口にし岸を探れ。
そこに黄金郷への鍵が眠る。

鍵を手にせし者は、以下に従いて黄金郷へ旅立つべし。

第一の晩に、鍵の選びし六人を生贄に捧げよ。
第二の晩に、残されし者は寄り添う二人を引き裂け。
第三の晩に、残されし者は誉れ高き我が名を讃えよ。
第四の晩に、頭を抉りて殺せ。
第五の晩に、胸を抉りて殺せ。
第六の晩に、腹を抉りて殺せ。
第七の晩に、膝を抉りて殺せ。
第八の晩に、足を抉りて殺せ。
第九の晩に、魔女は蘇り、誰も生き残れはしない。
第十の晩に、旅は終わり、黄金の郷に至るだろう。

魔女は賢者を讃え、四つの宝を授けるだろう。

一つは、黄金郷の全ての黄金。
一つは、全ての死者の魂を蘇らせ。
一つは、失った愛すらも蘇らせる。
一つは、魔女を永遠に眠りにつかせよう。

安らかに眠れ、我が最愛の魔女ベアトリーチェ。

h3. Comments on epitaph wording

* In the first line,

 | 懐かしき|、|故郷|を|貫く|鮎|の|川|
 |natsukashiki|,|kokyou|o|tsuranuku|ayu|no|kawa|
 |beloved/fondly-remembered|,|hometown|[object marker]|run-through|sweetfish|[possessive]|river|

 this comma indicates that "beloved/fondly-remembered" does not directly modify the following noun "hometown"; instead "hometown" is just the first word of a longer clause which will end with a noun for "beloved/fondly-remembered" to modify (in this case, "river"). So, technically, it should be interpreted as "the beloved sweetfish river that runs through my hometown" and not "the sweetfish river that runs through my beloved hometown". There are multiple Japanese pages on the Internet that agree with this.   
 WH's/Jessica's/Battler's interpretation in 1-6, where they both refer to the phrase "懐かしき故郷" as if there was no comma present, should be wrong from a grammatical point of view.  
 Maybe Maria copied the epitaph down incorrectly and omitted the comma? This isn't out of the realm of possibility since Battler and Jessica both independently read the tenth twilight as "shall reach 黄金郷 (the Golden Land)" instead of "shall reach 黄金の郷 (the home of the gold)" indicating that Maria might have left out the の there too.
* On the first twilight, the wording 生贄に捧げる _ikenie ni sasageru_ (lit. offer as sacrifice) is the most common way to express the simple English verb "sacrifice" in Japanese (where 生贄 is only a noun and cannot be used as a verb). Magic: the Gathering also uses the verb "to sacrifice" and it is rendered as 生贄に捧げる in the Japanese translation. The longer phrasing of "offer as sacrifice" is an artifact of the Japanese language and not something intentionally verbose.
* 安らかに眠れ _yasuraka ni nemure_ is basically a Japanese equivalent to English "rest in peace" and used in the same way (has connections with death).
* 永遠の眠り _eien no nemuri_ (actually に in the epitaph but not so important) is basically a Japanese equivalent to "eternal rest/sleep/slumber" and again has the same connections with death. The に technically means it is an adverbial usage, i.e. "eternally" instead of "eternal", but the connotations are of course still present.
* The 郷 [HOME/HOMETOWN/HOMELAND] and 里 [COUNTRYSIDE/VILLAGE] kanji are homophones under the _sato_ reading, and 郷 can mean 里 when read as _sato_ on its own (so, in the context of 黄金の郷 on the tenth twilight).
* 我が最愛の魔女ベアトリーチェ (_wa ga saiai no majo Beatrice_, my beloved witch Beatrice) seen in the last line is also the title of the portrait. Note that 最愛 _saiai_ is the base idiomatic word  meaning   " "beloved":http://eow.alc.co.jp/search?q=%E6%9C%80%E6%84%9B&ref=sa " or "well-beloved" or "dearly beloved" and is not a word that verbosely goes even further than a more generally-used idiomatic term to point out someone as "the _most_ dearly beloved of all people", _even though_ it is made of the characters for most + love.

h2. Solution to the epitaph

{{cut_start((Spoiler))}}

h3. The key

* The 故郷 (_kokyou_, hometown) mentioned in the first line refers to Taiwan, which Kinzo has ties to from his earlier years.
* The 鮎 (_ayu_, sweetfish) mentioned in the first line are a reference to 淡水 _tansui_, freshwater, as a freshwater fish. 
** Wiki: "A river is a natural watercourse,[1] **usually freshwater**, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea, or another river." 
** Wiki: "adult [sweetfish] **ascend from coastal waters into the lower reaches of rivers** to spawn in the spring. The larvae descend to the sea immediately on hatching and winter there before returning to **fresh water** again in the spring."
* The 川 (_kawa_, river) mentioned in the first line is a metaphor for a **railway line** in Taiwan.
* The railway line in Taiwan with links to 淡水 (_tansui_, freshwater) is the 淡水線 (_tansuisen_, **Tansui/Tamsui Line**).
** Not "the modern one that started construction in 1988":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsui_Line_(Taipei_Metro) of course, but the "old one from 1901 to 1988 that is now defunct":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsui_Line_(TRA) .
** However the stations are similar, Wiki: "The Taipei Metro Tamsui Line currently operates along a route similar to that of the one occupied by the TRA Tamsui Line during its existence."
* The second line instructs you to go downstream, i.e. travel down the line visiting the stations (towards the sea I guess, but the direction is unimportant).
* The third line indicates that as you go down, やがて里あり (_yagate sato ari_, before long there will be a 里/sato/village). This is a reference to finding a **里 character in a station name**.
* One (or maybe the only?) station in "the list":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsui_Line_(Taipei_Metro) that contains a 里 shape is **唭哩岸 (_kirigan_, Qilian)**. 里 is present in the second character. **This will be our key.**
** Visiting its "wiki page":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilian_Station you can verify that it was indeed on the old line as well.
* The fourth line indicates that you must その里にて二人が口にし岸を探れ (_sono sato ni te futari ga kuchi ni shi kishi o sagure_, in that village search for the shore two speak of). This describes the kanji of the name 唭哩岸, verifying and reinforcing that 唭哩岸 is correct.
** 二人が口にし (_futari ga kuchi ni shi_, two speak of) describes the two 口 (_kuchi_, mouth/speak) characters that can be seen on the left-hand side of characters 1 and 2.
** 里 (_sato_, village) is in the right-hand side of character 2.
** その (_sono_, that) can also be written 其の (_sono_), and this 其 is in the right-hand side of character 1.
** Finally, 岸 (_kishi_, shore) is character 3. That accounts for every part of the name 唭哩岸.
* The first twilight's 鍵の選びし六人 (_kagi no erabishi rokunin_, six people chosen by the key) indicates that the key contains six letters. So the key is actually the romanization, **Qilian**.

h3. The lock

* As theorized in the game, there is a lock phrase from which we need to sacrifice/kill/delete letters, including the six specified by the key.
* The lock contains at least the letters "q, i, l, i, a, n" and the five which are definitely said to be "killed" for a total of at least eleven, though the possibility exists for more depending on interpretation (e.g. second twilight; ninth twilight).
* On the tenth twilight, you will reach the 黄金の郷 (_ougon no sato/kyou_, home of the gold). This 郷 is the same one from 黄金郷 (_ougonkyou_, Golden Land), as well as from 故郷 (_kokyou_, hometown/land) from the first line, and also in Gohda's name incidentally (although that's irrelevant but a nice red herring).
* As theorized in the game itself, 郷 is separated from the rest of the name in this one instance to draw attention to it and analyze it on its own.
* 郷 is a reference to the identically-pronounced kanji 京 (_kyou_), carrying meanings of "capital", "Tokyo", "Kyoto"...
* ...and also "10,000,000,000,000,000" -- it's one of the number kanji, rarely used because it's so high (but we can document it still in grimoire -- there's a good opportunity when Kinzo mentions nayuta and other Buddhist high numbers). In this case it's pronounced _kei_ and not _kyou_, but that is irrelevant.
* Since we arrive at 10,000,000,000,000,000 on the tenth twilight, by the first twilight (which is one-tenth of the way to the tenth twilight) we are only at one-tenth of that.
* One-tenth of 10,000,000,000,000,000 is 1,000,000,000,000,000.
* The English name for this number is **quadrillion**. It contains the six required letters and has a total length of eleven, so we can be reasonably sure we have it right.
* There are a couple of places on Rokkenjima where that number has been seen before...
** Kuwadorian is an intentionally bastardized Japanese pronunciation of quadrillion.
** Toraian (official name of the guesthouse) is the same for trillion, incidentally.
** The inscription above the chapel mentions the number: <pre>
It looked like some message had been written there in English.
...The rust showed that the message had been written there since construction.
".........I'm bad at English. ......What is it...? ......<This door is, opened, only at, probability of>?? Sorry, my English sucks."
I gave up after I was unable to finish reading the first of the two lines.
...It looked like the others could read it properly.
"...Umm, I think it went "m", "b", "t", "q", so, ...umm, umm...how many did that mean...I think, ...umm...umm, ............"
"......Anyway, this is incredible. You can't even count close to that with all the fingers on both hands.
It really would be impossible unless a miracle occurred."
[...]
"...It means something like this. "This door is opened only when a miracle occurs. You will be blessed only when a miracle occurs"."
</pre>George is able to read the inscription, reads the word "quadrillion" (although it is not explicitly included in the VN's dialogue) and he spends time trying to remember its numerical value, going through "m, b, t, q" (million, billion, trillion, quadrillion). Then the message is paraphrased by the VN to avoid saying the word "quadrillion" explicitly. The original text on the chapel may be "This door is opened only at a probability of one quadrillion to one."
* Sacrifice "QILIAN" from "QUADRILLION" → " -Q- U -A- D R -I- L L -I- O -N- " and one of the "L"s... so we have either @_U_DR__L_O_@ or @_U_DR_L__O_@
* Tear apart the two who are close. That refers to moving the two nestling letters away from one another, and can only be done in the first case, giving us @_U_DR__L_O_@ -> @_U_D_R_L_O_@
* Praise his noble name. The epitaph having been written by Kinzo... how can we refer to him nobly with the five letters we have remaining... "Lord U(shiromiya)". We rearrange them in that order @_L_O_R_D_U_@
* Now kill the five in order from left to right (top of the body to the bottom).
* These operations are to be carried out on the removable letterforms of the word "quadrillion" appearing on the lettering of the text above the chapel.
* With that, the door opens to the Golden Land...

h3. The final paragraphs

* No particular significance? As Jessica says, perhaps just so that by the end the entire riddle's effect sums up to "(the witch awakens, but sleeps again) (people die, but come alive again) and just the gold is gained" which is the same as the actual real-life outcome of solving the riddle when all the fantasy is discarded?
* Or maybe it expresses Kinzo's desire to "put the witch to sleep", and finally end his obsession with her after seeing her once more?
* Ask Levani xD

h2. English epitaph translation

(Revised once again 2014-11-07...)

Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.

As you travel down it, you will see a village.
In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.
There the key to the Golden Land sleeps.

You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land.

On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.
On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.
On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name.
On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.
On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.
On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.
On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.
On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.
On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.

The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.

One shall be all of the Golden Land's gold.
One resurrects all the dead people's souls.
One even revives all the love they possessed.
And one for the witch to eternally rest.

Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.

h3. Notes about English translation

{{cut_start((Spoiler))}}
* *sacrifice* : (instead of "offer as sacrifice") -- because there is no reason to make it intentionally verbose in English by including "offer" (see above). Also, the word "offer" is not relevant to the puzzle.
* *home of the gold* : WH had "capital where the gold dwells", but that is a representation of 京 and not the 郷 which *actually* appears in the epitaph, meaning that a logic step is skipped (homophone 郷 _kyou_ → 京 _kyou_) which is likely to create issues with a translation that uses all the voice files and does not attempt to mess with the character dialogue (characters puzzle through and also explain the epitaph). Our characters will refer to 郷 as they do in the original. *Added: Home of the Gold with capitals, to give greater link between that and Golden Land (a link which is far more obvious in JP)*
* *rhyming lines* : because they don't have much puzzle significance and can be rhymed reasonably easily (if this epitaph had originally been written in English, it would probably rhyme), although I am not necessarily happy with them yet.
** Aw, so many awesome rhyming lines I keep thinking of but not enough to do the epitaph with without ruining it xD "You who stand with key in hand, begin your journey to the Golden Land."
* -I badly want to shorten the line "The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules", as well as possibly some other lines, as it is the longest line we have and may give us space issues.- Fixed.
* -I want to get rid of the ugly "revive/alive" accidental awkward rhyme on the ninth twilight, somehow, again without being too verbose.- fixed by removing double "shall" and giving "revive" an extra "s". Now a bit shorter too.
* I shuffled the word order for the "shore" line to remove (as best as possible) unnecessary English filler words like "will" and "for", which complicate a line where almost every word is supposed to be puzzle-relevant (including "that"/sono/其の).
* *2014-11-07: I think the rhyming lines might be final now. Finally have something that is close enough and doesn't sound awkward, I think...*
* *Added: Flipped around a line near the top so I didn't have two lines in a row ending with "Golden Land".*

h2. Russian epitaph translation

Через край родной мой, отрада моя, изобильная айю река катит воды свои.
Ты, кто ищет Золотую Землю, за её течением вниз последуй в поисках желанного ключа.

По течению вниз спустившись, набредёшь ты на деревню.
В ней разыщи ты берег, о котором тебе расскажут двое.
Там ключ ты к Золотой Земле найдёшь.

Когда же ключ ты обретёшь, отправься в путь, условия блюдя.

В первые сумерки ключ изберёт шестерых — в жертву их принеси.
Вторые сумерки — оставшиеся разлуку паре принести должны, в которой оба дороги друг другу.
На третьи сумерки, кто выжил, тем славить имя благородное моё.
К четвёртым — дыру проделав в голове вращеньем, умертви.
К пятым — дыру проделав во груди вращеньем, умертви.
К шестым — дыру проделав в животе вращеньем, умертви.
К седьмым — дыру проделав в колене вращеньем, умертви.
К восьмым — дыру проделав во стопе вращеньем, умертви.
К девятым сумеркам же возродится ведьма, и кто в живых остался — будет мёртв.
К десятым сумеркам конец пути настанет — к истоку золота дорога приведёт.

Похвалит ведьма мудрых и вручит им четыре дара:

Первый — всё золото, что в Золотой Земле.
Второй — из праха мёртвых воскрешение.
Третий — возвращение утраченной любви.
Четвёртый — ведьме сном забыться вечным.

Покойся с миром, моя возлюбленная ведьма {f:5:Беатриче}.

h3. Notes about Russian translation

{{cut_start(Spoiler)}}
* край: "故郷" (родина, родные места) does not imply it is a town, furthermore, a solution to the epitaph has nothing to do with some town, but on the opposite, with a country.
* отрада моя: there should be some room to relate this to both river (correct) and Kinzo's home (wrong).
* Ты, кто ищет Золотую Землю: English doesn't have participles, definitely it is not a reason for us not to pick one (and to shorten the line). However, for a smooth sounding the line requires at least four syllables.
* на родину золота: check English translation note, the only thing I can add is it will be grimoired.
* Покойся с миром: a literal translation to "requiescat in pace" is "да упокоится в мире", however, Kinzo is neither a priest, nor a stranger to Beatrice. "покойся с миром" is what relatives are likely to say and a known alternative in RIP interpretation.
* дыру проделав… вращеньем: 抉る as a motion implies rotation, furthermore, they discuss these lines in Chiru, we have to preserve a same construction for them all.
